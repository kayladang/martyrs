The martyrdom of Saint Grigor the Persian, in the 15th year of the reign of Xusrō, son of Hormizd, king of the Persians. A command went out from the king through all the provinces of his sovereignty / principality (*ənd amenayn gawaṙ̇s išxanut‘ean iwroy*), that those who had come from the nation of the Persians who had confessed in Christ would be seized and held in prison, and persecuted with harsh torments, so that apostates from the service of God (?) would worship the sun and serve the fire. And when this command reached judges (*datawors*) all over, there was much agitation in the holy church, and great sorrow, since in every province, by ardently holding his faith, they would bring bitter torments upon (themselves). For them there arrived divine help that tempered their hearts towards patience, out of which they endured many tortures, by sword and by fire, and strangulation and crucifixion,  with good courses they crowned the hair / conduct (?)  of their lives. 

In that time, there was a certain man whose name was Manačihr,  from the land of Ṙažik (i.e. Rayy), from a family called Mihran. He was in the army (*zinvorut‘iwn*) in the land of the Georgians (*Vrac‘ ašharh*), and he hoped in the God of heaven and earth, in the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, and he took the name Grigorios; him did  the Holy Spirit arrange for battle in the ranks of the angels.

This blessed Grigorios suffered many torments from the marzpan of the Georgians, whose name was Ervand-Všnasp,  because after he hung the holy one head-downwards, they beat him with a stick and he even smashed the bones of his skull with fetters. And having judged the holy one mercilessly in this way, he wasn’t at all able from that day (?) to shake the firmness of his faith.

Then he thought to himself that he was a blessed man, and sent him in chains to the court of the king. And when the holy one arrived in the camp, he went before the *mogpet*. And having learned that although the holy one had suffered much, he did not deny (his faith), when he entered the palace he asked the king about the holy martyr, that he would give the command to kill him.

The king replied and said: “You have one man killed and you create many Christians, since at his death many would abandon our religion (*den*) and turn to their God.” The *mogpet* said unto the king: “No matter whom this man, who has become an apostate, is descended from, our laws do not command us to save him.”

And he received a command from the king to kill the blessed one. And after he left, he sat with all the *naxarars* to give judgment on the holy one. And once he was led before them, he promised him gifts and great honors if he would deny the true faith and worship the elements: the sun and moon and water and fire. Then if he would not return, he threatened to bring upon him intolerable torments and a painful death.

Then the holy Girgorios, having become even more bold, with a loud voice denied their polytheism and confessed faith in Christ, the son of God on high, who in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, the consubstantial Trinity, with a resounding shout publicly confessed before all the Persian Magian crowd (*amenayn parskakan mogakoyt*).  

At that time the mogpet ordered all the loyal Magians to carry the holy Grigor to a different place and kill him by sword. And when they had brought the holy one to the place, they cut off his head while he praised the all-holy Trinity, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, and by worshipping (his) glory (?) we might also approach this great dominion (?), so that glory and power and honor are his (lit. “are proper for him”) now and always and forever and ever. Amen.
